/**
 * <h1>Gridder: Never Deal With GridBagConstraints Again</h1>
 * 
 * This class makes Swing's GridBagLayout easier, even a pleasure,
 * to use. It provides an interface to GridBagLayout that resembles
 * that of the Tcl/Tk grid layout manager. It also provides a text-
 * based layout function, with which you can write a string that
 * represents the position and extent of each component in a 2D
 * fashion.
 * <p>
 * This class is merely a thin wrapper around GridBagLayout and
 * GridBagConstraints. It does not perform any layout management
 * itself, it is just a convenient way to specify layout
 * information to GridBagLayout.
 * 
 * <h2>Basic Usage</h2>
 * 
 * To use Gridder, create a Gridder instance and give it the container
 * you want it to manage, as well as any default constraints as a
 * simple string of "constraintName value" pairs (or as multiple
 * strings of such values, or as constraint names followed by their
 * string, integer, or floating-point values, since the final argument
 * to Gridder() is a varargs array).
 * <br><br> 
 * <pre>
 *    JFrame topLevel = new JFrame();
 *    Gridder gr = new Gridder(topLevel.getContentPane(),
 *          "weightx 1.0 weighty 0.0",
 *          "inset_top 5", "inset_bottom", 5,
 *          "anchor center","fill","xy");
 * </pre>
 * 
 * You can then add components via the Gridder object, which handles
 * all the nastiness of setting up the GridBagConstraints.
 * <br><br> 
 * <pre>
 *    // Uses the default constraints, places label at row 0, column 2.
 *    gr.add(new JLabel("Name:"),0,2);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * For any individual component, you can override the default constraints
 * in the add() method (which does not change the defaults). Constraints
 * are specified exactly as they are to the Gridder constructor.
 * <br><br>
 * <pre>
 *    JTextField nameFld = new JTextField();
 *    gr.add(nameFld,0,3,"weightx", 4.0,"fill horizontal");
 * </pre>
 * 
 * You can also call gr.updateConstraints("constraint1 value1 ...") to
 * update the default constraints, which will then be used for all
 * future add() calls.
 * <p>
 * In general, all constraint names are the same as the corresponding
 * member names of the GridBagConstraints class. The exception is the
 * GridBagConstraints.insets member, which is realized here as
 * separate constraints inset_top, inset_bottom, inset_left, and
 * inset_right. Gridder also supports constraint name abbreviations,
 * as well as many alternative values for the anchor and fill
 * constraints (see the table below).
 * <p>
 * Constraint values can be specified as either raw values of the
 * appropriate type, or as strings that can be converted to the
 * appropriate type.
 * <p>
 * Unrecognized constraints or constraints with invalid
 * values cause a RuntimeException. Since the expected usage of
 * this class is to set up a container at UI-construction time,
 * I expect such problems to occur only during development, so
 * throwing a RuntimeException seems reasonable.
 * <p>
 * Constraint names, values, and defaults (if not specified in the
 * Gridder constructor or the add() method) are summarized in the
 * following table (note that the defaults for weights are different
 * when text-based layouts are used - see below).

 * </pre>
 *
 * Constraint names and values are <em>case insensitive</em>, so "ANCHOR NW" is
 * a valid constraint.
 * 
 * <h2>2D Text-Based Layouts</h2>
 * 
 * The other, and sometimes more convenient way to use Gridder is
 * to parse a textual layout string, and then add components to the
 * container using identifiers mentioned in the layout string. 
 * You should either use a text-based layout or the plain
 * add(Component,row,column) API for any given container, not both.
 * 
 * <h3>The 2D Layout Language</h3>
 * 
 * For example, here is a somewhat complex layout:
 * <br><br>
 * <pre>
 * String layout =
 *    "    {c1                 + + c2}    "+
 *    "    {c3:wx1,wy2,i*5,fxy + c4 +}    "+
 *    "    {|                  - - c5}    "+
 *    "    {|                  - c6 +}    ";
 * gr.parseLayout(layout);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * (Whitespace added to layout string for clarity.) Such a string
 * represents a rectangular array of grid cells and identifies
 * the position and extent of each component. This layout says that:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li> Component c1 occupies the first three cells of row 0
 *   (+ means "extend the previous component into this column").
 * <li> Component c2 occupies the fourth cell of row 0.
 * <li> Component c3 occupies the first two cells of row 1, and
 *   extends two cells downward to row 3 (| means "extend
 *   the component directly above into this row"). This component
 *   also contains embedded constraints that will be used to
 *   override the default constraints supplied to the gridder
 *   constructor: weightx = 1.0, weighty = 1.0, all inset values
 *   set to 5, and fill set to xy. The syntax of those constraints
 *   is described below.
 * <li> Component c4 occupies the third and fourth cells of
 *   row 1.
 * <li> Component c5 occupies the fourth cell of row 2.
 * <li> Component c6 occupies the third and fourth cells of
 *   row 3.
 * <li> The cell at row 2, column 2 is empty.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * 
 * In general, 
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li> Curly brackets { and } delimit each grid row
 * <li> + causes the gridwidth of the component to the
 *   left to be increased by 1
 * <li> | causes the gridheight of the component *directly*
 *   above to be increased by 1
 * <li> The + and | characters extending down and to the right of a component
 * denote the extent of that component
 * <li> - simply occupies space. It is used to fill in the space
 *   occupied by multi-cell components, and to fill empty cells.
 *   All grid cells must be filled with either a component identifier or
 *   one of the characters |-^&lt;+
 * <li> &lt; is a synonym for + and ^ is a synonym for |, for
 *   historical compatibility with an earlier version
 *   of this code
 * <li> Whitespace within a layout string is ignored except that
 *   component identifiers such as "c1" are delimited by either
 *   whitespace or one of the other layout characters {}|-^&lt;+
 * <li> Component identifiers are any string that contains
 *   no whitespace and none of the characters {}|-^&lt;+
 * <li> If a component identifier contains a colon, the
 *   characters following the colon are interpreted as a
 *   comma-separated list of constraints in the format
 *   constraintNameValue, with no space between constraint
 *   name and value. The constraint names are as described in the
 *   table above. Thus, "c1:wx1.0" and "c1:weightx1.0" may
 *   both be used to set the "weightx" constraint of
 *   component "c1" to 1.0. Using the short constraint
 *   names helps to keep a 2D layout compact. If you prefer
 *   maximally-compact 2D layouts, do not use embedded
 *   constraints; instead, specify override constraints in
 *   the add() method as described below.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The layout string above is a completely valid example, even
 * with the additional whitespace. It could have been specified
 * without extra whitespace like this:
 * <br><br>
 * <pre>
 *    String layout="{c1++c2}{c3:wx1,wy2,i*5,fxy+c4+}{|--c5}{|-c6+}";
 * </pre>
 * 
 * but that would defeat the purpose of making the 2D structure
 * of the layout clear.
 *
 * <h3>Adding Components to a Text-Based Layout</h3>
 *
 * To add a component to a container based on the last layout
 * string parsed, use the add(String layoutId,Component comp)
 * method, and set the layoutId to a layout identifier from
 * the layout string. For example,
 * <br><br>
 * <pre>
 *    gr.add("c1",new JLabel("Top left label"));
 * </pre>   
 * 
 * adds the JLabel at the position of the "c1" token in the
 * layout string. You can add components in any order, since
 * their grid positions and extents are derived from the
 * layout string.
 * <p>
 * As in the other add() method, you can specify additional
 * constraints:
 * <br><br>
 * <pre>
 *    JButton btn1 = new JButton("Push me");
 *    gr.add("c2", btn1, "weightx 5.0 fill horizontal");
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Any constraints specified in the add() method will override
 * both the default constraints supplied to the Gridder constructor
 * and any embedded constraints from the layout string.
 * <p>
 * When using text-based layouts, keep in mind that any gridwidth
 *    or gridheight constraints you supply will
 *    be ignored, since those constraints will be derived from
 *    the layout string.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is, of course, possible to write a nonsensical layout
 * using the simple layout language described above. In the
 * interest of keeping it simple, the code does not defend
 * against this possibility. So don't do that.
 * </p>
